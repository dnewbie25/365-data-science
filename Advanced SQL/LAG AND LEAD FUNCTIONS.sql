/*Exercise #1:

Write a query that can extract the following information from the "employees" database:

- the salary values (in ascending order) of the contracts signed by all employees numbered between 10500 and 10600 inclusive

- a column showing the previous salary from the given ordered list

- a column showing the subsequent salary from the given ordered list

- a column displaying the difference between the current salary of a certain employee and their previous salary

- a column displaying the difference between the next salary of a certain employee and their current salary

Limit the output to salary values higher than $80,000 only.

Also, to obtain a meaningful result, partition the data by employee number.*/

select emp_no, salary, 
lag(salary) over w as prev_salary, 
lead(salary) over w as next_salary,
lag(salary) over w - salary as diff_pre_current_salary,
salary - lead(salary) over w as diff_next_current_salary
from salaries where emp_no between 10500 and 10600 and salary > 80000
window w as (partition by emp_no order by salary asc)
;

/*Exercise #2:

The MySQL LAG() and LEAD() value window functions can have a second argument, designating how many rows/steps back (for LAG()) or forth (for LEAD()) we'd like to refer to with respect to a given record.
With that in mind, create a query whose result set contains data arranged by the salary values associated to each employee number (in ascending order). Let the output contain the following six columns:
- the employee number
- the salary value of an employee's contract (i.e. which weâ€™ll consider as the employee's current salary)
- the employee's previous salary
- the employee's contract salary value preceding their previous salary
- the employee's next salary
- the employee's contract salary value subsequent to their next salary
Restrict the output to the first 1000 records you can obtain.*/

select emp_no, salary, lag(salary) over w as previous_salary, lag(salary, 2) over w as preceed_prev_salary,
lead(salary) over w as next_salary,
lead(salary, 2) over w as subsequent_next_salary
from salaries
window w as (partition by emp_no order by salary desc)
limit 1000;
